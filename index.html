            <img src="./assets/images/my-photo.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="My Photo">

            <p>I spent most of my adult life in graduate school studying Anthropology. I had every intention of obtaining my Ph.D. and pursuing a career teaching Anthropology at a major univeristy. After several years, I found myself unsatisfied and growing increasingly frustrated with academia. I chose to leave, discovered a passion for web development, and never looked back.</p>

            <p>I enjoy creating aesthetically-pleasing, user-friendly web applications that really capture the essence of those providing them. I love spending time fine-tuning HTML and CSS until the "feel" is right and then working with Javascript and jQuery to add those bits of functionality that make the user experience pain-free and enjoyable. Ensuring everything is mobile-friendly is especially important to me.</p>

            <p>Though I prefer to focus on the frontend, I can also ensure a web application has the ability to store and utilize data. I am always up for a challenge and I have the ability to learn new tools and languages quickly.</p>
